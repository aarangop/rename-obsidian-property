- In antiquity, it was thought that history was a cyclical process, whereby history repeated itself. Natural catastrophe and wars would erase civilizations, causing mankind to start anew from scratch. This position was held by Plato and Aristotle.
- The Judeo-christian tradition was perhaps the first one to attempt to sketch a world history, or a history of humanity. It proposed a beginning and an end (judgement day).
- A secular interpretation of human history had to wait and came along with the scientific method. The scientific method maybe allowed philosophers and historians to treat history as just another subject of investigation. 
- Furthermore, the passage of time since the ancient greeks provided a historical horizon, from where history could be traced. Ancient greeks had no such advantage. Their historical horizon was myth and religion, spanning back to time immemorial. It would’ve been hard to believe that there was such a thing as progress, or a sort of [[Hegelian dialectic|historical dialectic]].
- Illustration era thinkers, like Voltaire and Condorcet, and later Kant proposed a view of humanity’s history as an evolving process, which relied heavily on the passage of ideas, knowledge and tradition from older generations to the present ones, implying that the present is, in this sense, better, as we don’t need to go through all past events to re-learn the lessons, and re-invent.
